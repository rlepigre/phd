      Semantics and Implementation of an Extension of ML
      <br/>
      for Proving Programs
    </h2>
    <p>
      We design an ML style programming language with support for proofs of
      programs. The idea is to combine, in a single tool, the flexibility of
      a practical programming language and a great specification power. In
      other words, the system can be used for programming (in the strongly
      typed, functional programming sense) and the level of guarantees met by
      programs can then be increased on a by-need basis, by proving more
      properties (e.g. show that a list is sorted). Such properties can
      be specified thanks to the reflexion of an equivalence relation over the
      terms of the language, into its type system. Another essential component
      is a dependent function type, that can be understood as a form of typed
      quantification. We can thus express properties that range, for examples,
      over all the natural numbers or over all the binary search trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure the correctness of the system (logical consistency and runtime
      safety), a theoretical framework based on Krivine's classical realisability
      has been designed. The construction of the model relies on an essential
      property that links the different levels of interpretations of types
      in a novel way. The obtained semantics can be combined with subtyping to
      yield a type system that is suitable for implementation. To account for our
      new connectives, we introduce a ternary relation t ∈ A ⊂ B called pointed
      subtyping. It is interpreted as the implication &ldquo;if t has type A,
      then it also has type B&rdquo;.
