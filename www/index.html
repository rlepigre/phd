    <h2>
      Semantics and Implementation of an Extension of ML
      <br/>
      for Proving Programs
    </h2>
    <p>
      In recent years, proof assistant have reached an impressive level of
      maturity. They have led to the certification of complex programs such
      as compilers and operating systems. Yet, using a proof assistant requires
      highly specialised skills and it remains very different from standard
      programming. To bridge this gap, we aim at designing an ML-style
      programming language with support for proofs of programs, combining in a
      single tool the flexibility of ML and the fine specification features of
      a proof assistant. In other words, the system should be suitable both for
      programming (in the strongly-typed, functional sense) and for gradually
      increasing the level of guarantees met by programs, on a by-need basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      We thus define and study a call-by-value language whose type system extends
      higher-order logic with an equality type over untyped programs, a dependent
      function type, classical logic and subtyping. The combination of
      call-by-value evaluation, dependent functions and classical logic is known
      to raise consistency issues. To ensure the correctness of the system (logical
      consistency and runtime safety), we design a theoretical framework based
      on Krivine's classical realisability. The construction of the model relies
      on an essential property linking the different levels of interpretation of
      types in a novel way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We finally demonstrate the expressive power of our system using our prototype
      implementation, by proving properties of standard programs like the map
      function on lists or the insertion sort.
